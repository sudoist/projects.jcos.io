# Project: Work


## Summary

Had a quick project on the Disney Aulani site when I was still at RCG.

Mostly worked on the front-end implementation of redesign and making sure the data is mapped correctly.

Just did the CSS and a little template here and there.

So starting from this page until checkout are what Iâ€™ve worked on this project.

It was straightforward but there were many changes done.
