## Summary

WordPress version of my personal site.

The child theme was built on top of [Beans](https://www.getbeans.io/).

It is hard restoring the actual site especially with some of the elements being widgets.

A Wayback Machine screenshot is added to show how it was before.

- Bedrock is used to have a repo based [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) setup
- Deployed on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
