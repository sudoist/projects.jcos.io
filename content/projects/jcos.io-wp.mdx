# Project: Personal

[![Laravel Forge Site Deployment Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforge.laravel.com%2Fsite-badges%2F51d4cc65-7cad-40d0-a5c8-7837a69d1779&style=plastic)](https://forge.laravel.com/servers/733512/sites/2290638)

## Summary

WordPress version of my personal site.

The child theme was built on top of [Beans](https://www.getbeans.io/).

It is hard restoring the actual site especially with some of the elements being widgets.

A Wayback Machine screenshot is added to show how it was before.

- Bedrock is used to have a repo based [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) setup
- Deployed on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
