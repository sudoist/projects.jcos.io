# Project: Work


## Summary

A maintenance and minor improvements project for the current WordPress site and creation of an architecture to handle the growing LMS for more custom features.

> Since the [blog page](https://blog.skillsuccess.com/) is also a different WordPress install.
>
> I recommended to go with static site generators for speed and security.
>
> See link above for the static site.(No load times and no database)

The website revamp application plan was pitched and given to current leadership.

It involves using Laravel for more complex scenarios while still using the familiar language(PHP) for existing developers for less friction when switching.

There are also infrastructure suggestions to be more cost-effective, switching from WPEngine to managed DigitalOcean services.

Implementing the suggestions could save more than 50% of server costs.

I haven't backed up the powerpoint presentations,
other diagrams and documents
from my work drive.
