# Project: Work


## Summary


Conducting trainings for teams or end users.

At work, sometimes I do some informal knowledge sharing sessions on tools I use and technologies.

There was also a time at a bank where we launched the project and provided guides on how to use the system across branches in the region.

## Different settings

- Classroom like classes for end users on product launch
- Zoom and meeting room sessions
    - Informal meetings withing the team
        - Brown bag discussions on tools
            - Tailwind
            - Git
            - Docker | Docker Compose
            - CI/CD with Laravel Forge
        - Introduction to Agile, Kanban and Sprints
