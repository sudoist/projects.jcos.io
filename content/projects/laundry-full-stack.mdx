# Project: Personal


## Summary

An experimental project to have hands-on experience with NodeJS and Flutter.

During my time that Iâ€™m looking for work, I was trying out new technologies and learning new stuff.

An idea that came from everyday life when dealing with a laundry shop.

I wanted to create an app that customers can see if their laundry is ready and shop owners can give notifications on their side.

- Mobile app was made using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) was used for the API
