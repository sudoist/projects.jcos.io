# Project: Work


## Summary

The role was of a mix of UI and API developer for a support project.

For the API it was a Spring Microservices system with apigee as the gateway.

On the UI side was Angular with Polymer for the components.

Our tasks are determined every 2 weeks by what were assigned from from the Jira backlog.

Usual day was mostly supporting admins with the application or helping them resolve issues.

> Investigation if data issues or functional

Dev work includes finishing up tech debts, bug fixes and enhancements.
