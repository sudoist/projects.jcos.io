# Project: Work


## Summary

At Winled our tasks range from database design, application development and administration.

This is where I first learned to seriously learn about the documentation of any framework.

> First time I've read everything from [getting started to other features](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/readme).
>
> I really learned a lot during my time here.

Setting up an automated pipelines in Bitbucket to include the following tasks:

- Running tests
    - PHP unit
    - Browser tests
- Automatic deployments (Push to deploy)

We were also able to work on server maintenance and domain management.

It felt good to be a power user with access to almost everything.

One of the important work we did was to update an old version of a Laravel API then add new features.

- A key feature that we've added was to have a marketplace which can be used by resellers. (Tenancy)
- Improved the performance after migrating the data from the working database using batch and console commands.

Sometimes there were also updates on the website based from reported bugs and customer feedback.

- Web app built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
- Deployed on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
