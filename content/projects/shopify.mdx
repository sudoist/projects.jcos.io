# Project: Work


## Summary

Updated page templates and initial configuration of payment methods.

Imported the product listing using a custom script to pull images from google drive.

Used to work very occasional when thereâ€™s some minor issue like emails not received, etc.

Before they were on Shopify, I remember posting products on their FB page.
