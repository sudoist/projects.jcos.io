# Project: Work


## Summary

Customer Service Incentive Program.

A portal application to allow employees to vote and nominate colleagues to get awards based on their performance.

Built with JSP and Servlets with Postgres for database.

Each employee can login using their id then fill up a form with multiple steps.

Multiple criteria will be used such as Honesty, Empathy, Respect and etc.

After submission, the system will rank the employee with the most nominations for awarding.

This was my first project as a professional developer.

Delivered the project at least a month before the nomination period and conducted training for administrators and end-users.

> I didn't know how to use Git yet, we have a shared drive where we compile the changes at end of day.
> Simpler times.
