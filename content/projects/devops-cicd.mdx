# Project: Personal

## Summary

Started playing with Bitbucket Pipelines to automate deployments.

First exposed at work back in 2017, the infra they were using was Bamboo then moved to Jenkins.

I've experimented with several services like Travis CI, [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/) which uses Ansible for WordPress.

Currently I just went with 2 services.

Saves a lot of time with configuration. Easy to get started with hooking GitHub repos then push to deploy.

- For web server requirements, I go with [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/)
- For SPA and node apps, I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Vercel also provides good service but I've already setup domains with Netlify.
