## Summary

Fixed together another site for a spare domain.

sudoist.com is my original domain but I failed to renew it this year!

Anyway it still works as it is, maybe cached or something.

After failing renewal, the price is now 7000 USD. What a joke!

- The static site generator used for this project is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
