# Project: Work


## Summary

> Philippine National Bank (PNB) already has the solution to this mounting ATM theft problem.
>
> The PNB ATMSafe is the first innovative insurance product in the Philippines that secures and protects ATM cardholders and their accounts.
>
> For only Php 12.00 per month, ATMSafe replaces money stolen from a cardholder’s account as a result of skimming or any of the other forms of ATM theft scams.
>
> ATMSafe also ensures the safety of PNB ATM cardholders as it restores money stolen during an ATM robbery – up to Php 50,000 for a maximum of three (3) incidents per year.

This project is the first time I was assigned as team leader.

It serves information to the mainframe and process information to update customer's account status and balance.

> Basically a communication middleware between java app with mainframe.

The system generates monthly reports after processing.

After the banks merged, it is still live which takes over the new bank name.

I think that's only what I can share here.
