# Project: Personal


## Summary

Still work in progress but on hold due to other priorities.

I made this project to show that I can build and use different languages.

Common requirements are Java, Go, Python and NodeJS or TypeScript so I made this bundle all of them together.

The idea is to make a reddit clone but with simpler features.

Basic features include rating posts, comments and content.

As for the authentication I was looking to use AWS Cognito.

Repositories for the APIs are listed below:

- User service built with Java/Spring: [ps-user-service](https://github.com/sudoist/ps-user-service)
- Rating service built with Python/Flask: [ps-rating-service](https://github.com/sudoist/ps-rating-service)
- Comment service built with Go/Gin: [ps-comment-service](https://github.com/sudoist/ps-comment-service)
- Content service built with TypeScript/NestJS: [ps-content-service](https://github.com/sudoist/ps-content-service)

Same goes for the UI which is Angular, React and Vue.

In conclusion after some research, I went with the idea of Microservices and Micro Frontends.


Here's an image of the architecture of this project:

For the deployment, I was planning to put all projects into one ec2 instance as dockerized apps.

A friend recommended to just go with Kubernetes since that is what I was trying to do.

An image of planned server setup:

At the moment this is discontinued as I have other projects but will look back in some time.

Priority right now is to restore old projects and compile in this site.
