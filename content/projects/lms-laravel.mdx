## Summary

Remembering this now. This was a really huge project for only 2 developers.

Coming from another company which I also worked on an LMS, this project was a great challenge.

The CMS can do a lot things and was built from scratch.

In the UI side, there were a lot of nesting components and state management.

We've utilized Redis to handle cache and queueing for checkouts.

There was also a feature for migrating from old CMS.

> We've added ability to pull the data from live Joomla to this API's database.

At the end we were able to complete an end to end process from enrollment to generating a certificate.

The simplest project to liken this is like building Udemy but with exams.

- UI framework for this project is [Nuxt.js/Vue.js](https://nuxt.com/)
- API built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
- CSS framework with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
