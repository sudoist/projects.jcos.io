# Project: Work


[![Laravel Forge Site Deployment Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforge.laravel.com%2Fsite-badges%2Fa0caf279-2ec7-4022-b198-3f56728df81c&style=plastic)](https://forge.laravel.com/servers/733512/sites/2310060)


## Summary

This is a web application that gives the admins the ability to add employees into the system and manage their 201 Files.

One of the most complex part of this project is the assignment of schedule for employees.

The company is running on 24/7 operation thus managing their employeesâ€™ shifts was tedious.

They needed a solution that accepts the monthly schedule from Manpower Agency which automatically assigns the employee pools to shifts and day offs.

When launched this saves them a lot of time every month since they only need to upload the current schedule for the current month and the app does the assignments.

- UI framework for this project is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- API built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
