# Project: Personal


[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3256c3b1-0c81-4cb6-801f-bdea0a662a69/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/goofy-brahmagupta-ef496e/deploys)


## Summary

After WordPress, I've discovered static site generators and how easy it is to add content.

No database needed! The content was in Markdown.

I haven't changed it for a long time.

Really liked the idea of set it and forget it.

- The static site generator used for this project is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
