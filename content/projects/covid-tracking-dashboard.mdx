# Project: Work


## Summary

This was during Covid time.

A rush project that we needed to implement in 2 weeks to track employees’ status if they are able to enter the office premises.

I was working mainly as a Frontend developer on this project for a subsidiary of a Telecom company in the Philippines.

> FRONT END DEVELOPER LEAD (I even got a fancy job title to boot)

Below was the run down of my responsibilities

- Handled API responses to show information in easy to understand graphs and tables.
- Created Vue.js components for the UI
    - Integrated components with the backend

The project was completed within time.

It was handed over to a new set of development team while I was assigned to a new project.


## Sample Screens

Aaahhh, I lost my screenshots of the dashboard.

Here are some sample pages of the app that sends data to the dashboard.

Yeaaaaah this was frustrating.
